# Gql Functions

Gql Functions are automatically generated and imported based on the GraphQL operations in the project.

## Example

```graphql [example.gql]
query GetUsers {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}

mutation LoginUser($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  login(email: $email, password: $password) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

The GraphQL document above will generate two Gql Functions (`GqlGetUsers` and `GqlLoginUser`) that are automatically imported, and can be utilized as shown below:

```ts
async function loadUsers() {
  const result = await GqlGetUsers()
}

async function handleLogin(email: string, password: string) {
  const result = await GqlLoginUser(email, password)
}
```

## Understanding

Writing GraphQL operations in SFC components is **not supported**, this decision is at the heart of this module.

### Naming Convention

Gql Functions are named based on their GraphQL operation name. The operation name is [prefixed with `Gql`](configuration#functionprefix). 

It is recommended to uniquely name your GraphQL operations to avoid naming conflicts.

```graphql [example.gql]
query GetComments {
  comments {
    id
  }
}

mutation CreateComment ($input: CommentInput!) {
  createComment(input: $input) {
    id
  }
}
```

The GraphQL document above contains two (2) operations, `GetComments` and `CreateComment`. The Gql Functions generated from these operations are `GqlGetComments()` and `GqlCreateComment()` respectively.

### GraphQL Operations

GraphQL operations must be written in `.gql / .graphql` documents, and can be placed anywhere in the project. These documents are scanned and parsed to generate the necessary types and Gql Functions based on your GraphQL operations.

#### Grouping Operations

It is recommended to group related operations in a single file for better organization as seen in the example below.

```graphql [queries/user.gql]
query GetUser($id: String!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}

query GetUsers {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}

mutation CreateUser($input: UserInput!) {
  createUser(input: $input) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

#### Multiple Client Mode

In [Multiple Client Mode](/advanced/multiple-clients#multiple-client-mode) GraphQL documents must be manually associated with their respective client.

<!-- This is done by either naming the file with the special `<clientname>.gql|graphql` extension or by placing the document in a folder with the same name as the client. -->

This is done by either:

- Naming the file with the special `<clientname>.gql|graphql` extension. **This method takes precedence.**

```
/nuxt-app/queries/demo.spacex.gql
```

- Placing the document in a folder with the same name as the client.

```
/nuxt-app/queries/spacex/demo.gql
```

All GraphQL operations in this file will be associated with the `spacex` client.

GraphQL documents which don't match any of the aforementioned conventions are associated with the [default client](/advanced/multiple-clients#default-client)

## Limitations

Understanding the current drawbacks of Gql Functions is important to avoid common pitfalls.

### Chaining operations (Nuxt Context)

Gql Functions are not chainable. This is due to a current limitation of Vue 3 and inherently Nuxt 3, The context is lost during SSR after the first `await` statement, hence subsequent calls which rely on the nuxt instance context will fail.

The only exception here is when called directly within a plugin or the top level script setup.

```ts [Invalid approach]
// This will not work
export const useExample = async () => {
  const { user } = await GqlUser()

  /* 
    nuxt instance has been lost
  */

  const myState = useState('example')

  const { relations } = await GqlRelations({ id: user.id })
}
```

The solution here is to leverage the [`useGql` composable](/getting-started/composables#usegql) that Gql Functions are built on to maintain a single instance, and access any internal nuxt composables before the first `await` statement.

```ts [Recommended approach]
export const useExample = async () => {
  // create an instance to make multiple queries / mutations
  const GqlInstance = useGql()

  // access `useState` before the first `await` statement
  const myState = useState('example')

  const { user } = await GqlInstance('user')

  const { relations } = await GqlInstance('relations', { id: user.id })

  // myState can be utilized
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
Gql Functions, as well as internal Nuxt 3 composables such as ([useState](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/composables/use-state), [useRoute](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/composables/use-route), [useCookie](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/composables/use-cookie), etc) are reliant on the nuxt context.<br><br> The nuxt instance is lost **after the first `await` statement**, hence, calling any function that is reliant on the nuxt context will result in the nuxt instance unavailable error.
::

### Requires operation name

Gql Functions are only generated for operations that have a name.

```graphql [queries/posts.gql]
# bad practice
query {
  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}

# recommended
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Anonymous operations are skipped and inaccesible to your application.
